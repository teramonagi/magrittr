\title{magrittr - a forward-pipe operator for R}
\description{
This package provides pipe-forwarding mechanisms similar to
(but not exactly like) e.g. F#'s pipe-forward operator. It allows writing
code in a clean and readable way, and avoids making a
mess in situations of multiple nested function calls. It is particularly
useful when manipulating data frames etc. The package also contains
useful functions which fit well into the syntax advocated by the package. For
a brief introduction, see \code{vignette("magrittr")}.

The main feature is provided by the operator \code{\%>\%}. It takes a value
(e.g. a data.frame) on the left and a function expression on the right, see the
examples. One can use a single dot, \code{`.`},  as a placeholder for the
value on the left.
